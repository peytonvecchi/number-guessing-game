this number guessing game script...

1. picks a number between 1 and 20
2. has the user guess the number
3. records the amount of times the user guesses until they guess the correct number

The script will let the user know whether their guess is too low or too high if they don't guess the correct number.

Once the user guesses the correct number, the program will commend them and tell them how many times they guessed.
